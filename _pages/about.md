I am a postdoctoral associate working with [Mike Landy](https://wp.nyu.edu/landylab/) and [Jon Winawer](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/), at New York University. I obtained my PhD at Boston University, working in the lab of [Sam Ling](https://sites.bu.edu/vision/). Prior to that I got my MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University.
