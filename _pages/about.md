## About me 
I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Serge Dumoulin](https://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/) at the Spinoza Centre in Amsterdam, Netherlands. I obtained my PhD at Boston University, working in the lab of [Sam Ling](https://sites.bu.edu/vision/), and did postdoctoral research with [Mike Landy](https://wp.nyu.edu/landylab/) and [Jon Winawer](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/) at New York University. 

My past and current research focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying perception and cognition. Broadly, I am interested in how our perception of the world around us can be shaped by cognitive influences, such as attention and working memory. The methods I employ for my research span a wide range: **functional neuroimaging** (fMRI and intracranial EEG) to measure brain responses; **behavioral psychophysics** to measure human behavior; and, **computational modeling** to link brain and behavior to theoretical models.
